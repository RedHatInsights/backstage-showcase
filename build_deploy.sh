# This script builds and deploys the Web-RCA Service. In order to
# work, it needs the following variables defined in the CI/CD configuration of
# the project:
#
# QUAY_USER - The name of the robot account used to push images to
# 'quay.io', for example 'openshift-unified-hybrid-cloud+jenkins'.
#
# QUAY_TOKEN - The token of the robot account used to push images to
# 'quay.io'.
#
# The machines that run this script need to have access to internet, so that
# the built images can be pushed to quay.io.
#
#
# Optional variable:
#
# QUAY_REPOSITORY - The (quay) repository to use. Defaults to 'app-sre/web-rca'
#
#
# To debug run like this:
# QUAY_REPOSITORY="openshift-unified-hybrid-cloud/web-rca" QUAY_TOKEN=$(cat .quay-pass) QUAY_USER=martin_povolny ./build_deploy.sh
# note that you might need to change the GOROOT below or install Go in the specified path.
#

# Use podman or docker
